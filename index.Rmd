## Project Overview

This is a project that analyzes global suicide rates through publicly available datasets and statistical modeling. Suicide is a complex and deeply concerning public health issue, influenced by a wide range of socioeconomic, political, and regional factors.

This project seeks to answer:
**What are the key factors influencing suicide rates worldwide, and do these effects vary by region?**

To explore this, I merged four datasets — including suicide statistics, GDP per capita, Gini index, and health spending — to form a comprehensive dataset covering 156 countries from 2000 to 2021. Using exploratory data analysis and regression models, I examined both linear and interaction effects of predictors like income inequality and healthcare investment on suicide rates.

I conducted linear regression modeling using both raw and transformed suicide rates as the response, also incorporating interaction terms between region and predictors to capture geographic nuances.
