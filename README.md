# An Analysis on Key Factors that Influence Suicide Rates

## Project Overview

This is a project that analyzes global suicide rates through publicly available datasets and statistical modeling. Suicide is a complex and deeply concerning public health issue, influenced by a wide range of socioeconomic, political, and regional factors.

This project seeks to answer:

-   **What are the key factors that influence suicide rates and how do they influence suicide rates?**

-   **Do the relationships differ across regions around the world?**

To explore these questions, I merged four datasets — including suicide statistics, GDP per capita, Gini index, and health spending — to form a comprehensive dataset covering 156 countries from 2000 to 2021. Using exploratory data analysis and regression models, I examined both linear and interaction effects of predictors like income inequality and healthcare investment on suicide rates.

I conducted linear regression modeling using both raw and transformed suicide rates as the response, also incorporating interaction terms between region and predictors to capture geographic nuances.\

## Dataset, Code, and Report

The final dataset, source code, and the report are all contained in the "final_report" folder:

-   **final_dataset.csv** - This is the final merged dataset used for analysis, exported as a csv file.

-   **final_report.Rmd** - This R Markdown file contains the source code for data extraction, cleaning, analysis, as well as plot rendering and model fitting.

-   **final_report.pdf** - This is the final data analysis report document.
